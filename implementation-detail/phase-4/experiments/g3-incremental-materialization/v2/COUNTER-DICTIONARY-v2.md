# G3-v2 direct-counter dictionary

Status: **frozen before build or measurement**

The candidate command and all v1 flat JSON fields remain. v2 adds six explicit
reconciliation counters, complete build provenance, and repaired gate
expressions. This file restates the controlling equations so v2 analysis is
self-contained.

## Exact schedule and routes

| Seq | Scenario | Bytes | Route | Reason | Result |
|---:|---|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | `qualified-noop` | 10485760 | `qualified-noop` | `seed-hit` | success |
| 2 | `qualified-one-byte` | 104857600 | `qualified-patch` | `seed-hit` | success |
| 3 | `qualified-one-mib` | 10485760 | `qualified-patch` | `seed-hit` | success |
| 4 | `invalid-authority` | 1048576 | `complete-fallback` | `invalid-authority` | success |
| 5 | `external-mutation` | 1048576 | `complete-fallback` | `destination-invalidated` | success |
| 6 | `symlink-substitution` | 1048576 | `typed-rejection` | `destination-symlink` | `NativeDestinationSymlink` |
| 7 | `count-change` | 1048576 | `complete-fallback` | `count-change` | success |
| 8 | `before-publication-fault` | 1048576 | `qualified-patch` | `seed-hit` | `InjectedBeforePublication` |
| 9 | `lost-ack` | 1048576 | `qualified-patch` | `seed-hit` | success |

The row schema is `phase4-g3-row-v1`; this is deliberately unchanged candidate
behavior. Runner-added evidence uses v2 names and adds `source_set_sha256`.

## Required equations

```text
authority_validations = authority_validation_successes
                      + authority_validation_failures
payload_sql_queries = mapping_sql_queries + object_sql_queries
payload_sql_rows = mapping_sql_rows + object_sql_rows
canonical_blob_bytes = canonical_bytes_authenticated
attributed_wall_ns = sum(the ten named timer_*_ns fields)
operation_total_ns = attributed_wall_ns + unattributed_wall_ns
```

Qualified routes validate complete bindings, read protected seed authority, and
consume exactly one single-use permit. Invalid/stale/external/count/clone-fail
fallback and preflight rejection consume zero. A typed symlink/wrong-kind
preflight does no authority, SQL/BLOB/authentication, reconstruction, clone,
copy, patch, fallback, temp, sync, rename, or reconciliation work.

No-op has one successful clone and zero payload SQL/BLOB/authentication,
reconstruction, copy, patch, and fallback work. Qualified patches have one
successful clone, `patch_bytes = changed_bytes`, no complete reconstruction,
and authenticated bytes no greater than `changed_bytes + 1048576`. The exact
changed byte counts are 1, 1048576, 1, and 1 for the two patch rows,
before-publication fault, and lost acknowledgement. Complete fallback has one
call and:

```text
source_bytes_reconstructed = fallback_write_bytes = output_length
```

It has no clone, copy, patch, or permit consumption. Count change has output
length 1048577; other rows retain their input length.

Every published row has exact bytes/mode, zero seed/temp residue, one data sync,
one metadata sync, one rename, and one directory sync. A renamed temp satisfies
`temp_files_created = temp_files_removed + rename_calls`. Before-publication
fault has no rename, preserves `old`, and explicitly removes its temp. Lost ack
accepts only:

```text
(reconciliation_outcome, old_or_new) in {("target", "new"), ("prior", "old")}
```

Every other row reports `not-needed`; the symlink and before-publication rows
preserve `old`, while ordinary successful rows report `new`.

Ordinary payload/mapping/object/canonical/source counters exclude
reconciliation. v2 adds these non-negative observed counters:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `reconciliation_sql_queries`, `reconciliation_sql_rows` | Complete target/prior comparison SQL work. |
| `reconciliation_blob_reads` | Canonical BLOB acquisitions during reconciliation. |
| `reconciliation_canonical_bytes_authenticated` | Canonical bytes fully authenticated during reconciliation. |
| `reconciliation_source_bytes_compared` | Reconstructed canonical source bytes compared with the freshly opened destination. |
| `reconciliation_q_high_water` | Logical Q high-water attributable to reconciliation buffers/state. |

All six are zero when `reconciliation_calls = 0`. Lost ack requires each to be
positive. For target/new, `destination_bytes_read = output_length` and
`reconciliation_source_bytes_compared = output_length`; prior/old may perform
target then prior comparison and requires both values at least `output_length`.
`reconciliation_canonical_bytes_authenticated >= output_length`, and
`q_high_water >= reconciliation_q_high_water`. This full fault-recovery work is
descriptive and does not weaken the primary one-byte patch bound. Stable exact
different bytes map to `PublicationConflict`; read, wrong-kind, or pre/post
identity instability maps to `AmbiguousDurability`.

`q_terminal` is zero; Q high-water and external maximum RSS are at most 20 MiB.
Candidate temp/seed peaks and runner transient logical/apparent/allocated peaks
are at most 512 MiB. Physical I/O, cache warmth, and stable-media status remain
explicitly `Unavailable:` with reasons. Every operation is below 5 seconds,
their sum below 20 seconds, the build child below 30 seconds, and the complete
campaign below 59 seconds.

## Source and method custody

Each row's runner-added `source_set_sha256` must be a 64-hex digest equal to the
canonical digest in `SOURCE-CUSTODY-v2.json`. That record contains exactly the
four ordered source paths from the v2 preregistration, original/copy SHA-256,
size, original mode `0644`, copy mode `0400`, and distinct copy path. Binary
custody occurs only after the one recorded offline release build. Method custody
contains the v2 preregistration, dictionary, runner, primary analyzer,
independent analyzer, and post-static finalizer; the dry run is separately
hashed and copied.

Only the fresh exact `results-v2/work-v2` tree may be removed, by enumerated
no-follow unlink and `rmdir`. Raw rows are append-once, stdout/stderr and
chronology are once-only, and no result row may be retried.

## Static closure and finalization

After a PASS campaign, the parent creates `STATIC-CLOSURE-v2.json` with schema
`phase4-g3-v2-static-closure-v1`, the frozen `source_set_sha256`,
`candidate_retained: true`, and these exact ordered PASS command labels:

```text
focused-g3-tests
workspace-tests
workspace-clippy
workspace-fmt-check
git-diff-check
custody-review
```

Each command entry records its argv, zero exit code, and result-relative
stdout/stderr path, SHA-256, and size. `finalize_g3_v2.py` refuses incomplete or
non-PASS input, verifies campaign/ledger/custody/cleanup and sealed G2-v5
anchors, creates the payload manifest and PASS terminal, seals files `0444` and
directories `0555`, then performs independent manifest/hash/mode/closure
verification. The finalizer is never part of the measured campaign wall and is
not invoked by the zero-row dry run.
