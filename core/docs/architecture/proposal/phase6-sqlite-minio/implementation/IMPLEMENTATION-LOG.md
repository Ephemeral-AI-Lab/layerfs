# Phase 6 integration implementation log

> Status: Dated planning checkpoint; not release evidence or a product contract.

Append-only checkpoints. Current action/gates are maintained in CHECKLIST.md.

## 2026-10-02 — full autonomous objective received; V4a selected

Parent `1a59e129f8a3d73f49efe9691b53ba4b377be612`, clean owned worktree/branch
confirmed; active goal read from app state. Previous discussion/source inspection
is evidence progress, not implementation completion. Current V3 path has actual
full-provider two-head proof, but 512-inode/full-reconstruction/full-audit scope
cannot prove the user's larger/local-update objective. Those gaps remain required.

Confirmed source cause candidates: per-locator Noise/TCP setup, unary packs/PUTs,
repeated exact-CAS lookup, full metadata reconstruction and whole candidate audit.
Existing C1 already has EditSequence/apply_edits and PreparedRows/filesystem COW;
shipping daemon already retains authenticated control/service sessions. Public SDK
ProjectApi currently binds concrete Server, so genuine MinIO-backed Init must be
integrated before Family2 can qualify; direct prototype genesis is not its proof.

Own prospective V4a specification/checklist/log. No performance collection or
product enablement in this checkpoint. Next: fixed-size transport instrumentation,
one labelled diagnostic, then one session lifetime treatment preserving custody.
All five owner groups and all seven families are still incomplete. No #288 update,
release claim, merge, rollback or other-owner mutation is authorized.
