# R7 optimization ledger

> **Status:** Current planning checklist; no release candidate exists.

Dispatch: owner direction 2026-10-09, local `main`, one checkout. Start commit
`2f8e1ec422a40f4220c40315867c72dd3463ff28`; initial product identity `2b4dc28a6`.
All timing selections are exploratory and admission-ineligible. Global Store is
explicit Disposable/WAL/OFF; Durable is **NOT_RUN — disabled by owner until
explicit reauthorization**. Overlay remains MEMORY/OFF/EXCLUSIVE. No push,
publication, PR, worktree, predecessor retirement or reference retirement.

## Stage state

Stage 0 IN_PROGRESS. Three disjoint subagent tracks build prospective registry,
SDK real-binary lifecycle/fixture harness, and passthrough/per-file residency
tools. Lead owns every command receipt, timed sample, decision, record and commit.
Only one Cargo/Docker/test/measurement command holds the existing checkout lock.

| Iteration/checkpoint | Identity | Cells and ratios | Candidates/gates | Next step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0, preparation | initial identity above | No sample; ratios unavailable until Stage 0 | No kept product change. Stage 0 diagnostics access gap identified by source, not a measured optimization finding | Build release daemon, finish authentic harness, prepare full fixture once, prove lifecycle, expose mandatory counters before baseline |

## Prospective structural floors

These are direction bounds derived before optimization, not achieved results.
Exact per-opcode/capture-window accounting will refine them before each candidate.

| Ratio | Historical start (not a current timed sample) | Floor/model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Owner jobs/FUSE request | about 5 | One bounded atomic owner job when overlay state is required; zero when already-held authenticated state suffices. Necessary last-owner release still counted, never hidden |
| Store readers/wholly-local READ | 1 | Zero; local composition must establish no immutable-base demand before reader admission |
| Object demands/cold request | about 1 separately per neighbour | One grouped acquisition per existing bounded admitted plan; canonical dependency/authentication reads accounted separately |
| Owner jobs/captured row | about 31 at 672 rows | Fixed jobs per existing bounded 64-row window plus necessary affected-file construction and publication; no point job per membership question |
| Statements/captured row | about 130 | Indexed useful-row work per bounded window and necessary guarded writes; framing per window/job, not per point |
| Mount-to-Ready/unmount jobs | startup_cost counted | Constant in unrelated root/history size; exact attach/drain/custody jobs remain |
| FUSE requests/syscall | unavailable | At most same-profile P; necessary permission/coherence work retained |
| Wait/service per class | unavailable | No wait behind unrelated work without explicit resource/dependency justification; no numeric latency target invented |

## Decisions

1. Taken under the owner's direction of 2026-10-09: use three concurrent
   disjoint harness implementation tracks and serialize executions through the
   existing checkout lock. Subagents run no timings or Git mutations.
2. Taken under the owner's direction of 2026-10-09: Stage 0 must retain missing
   SDK diagnostics as UNAVAILABLE until an additive legitimate diagnostics path
   is implemented and proven. In-process functional tests cannot replace the
   real-daemon arm. This is required instrumentation, not an accepted speed win.
3. Taken under the owner's direction of 2026-10-09: pinned-image inventory is
   read-only and network-disabled. Missing `node` is a workload prerequisite,
   never permission to silently replace E07 or invoke commands in the fixture.

## Receipts

- [000 environment](000-environment/result.json): pinned image runs, ARM64 Linux
  6.12.76-linuxkit, `/dev/fuse` character device, bash/git available, node absent.
  This is an inventory, not a mounted proof or performance sample.
- [001 fuser provenance](001-fuser-provenance/result.json): authorized patch
  verification passed; no third-party modification.
- `002-linux-release-daemon-build`: initial release build in its own target,
  offline, pinned image and repository ARM flags; pending completion.

## Preservation

The handoff's protected containers, source checkout, temporary installed Store,
untracked handoffs and multi-workspace receipt remain untouched. Removal is
limited to resources created by this stage. Existing raw evidence is immutable.

## Commit accounting

Each commit is compared using pinned `tools/production_loc.py` through
`core/target/rx-count.py`: exact first parent versus staged tree, then committed
tree confirmation. Initial combined 184297; core 118880; active core 76006;
excluded predecessors 38878; excluded integration 3996; root reference 65417.
Harness/docs/test code is excluded. No staged source change may use estimates.

## Preparation checkpoint after ca2e70400

Committed-tree LOC confirmation matches staged tree `7ec678d256a1f1554b0e3f446d2eb92b0986924f`: combined184297/core118880/active76006/reference65417, delta0. Raw `/proc` stdout includes original trailing whitespace; `git diff --check` flagged it and the raw evidence was preserved. No clean whitespace claim is made for that raw file.

Release daemon build002 passed (56892314917ns external build wall; not performance). Full fixture copy003 passed with exact pinned commit and103108files/16867directories/10070symlinks/3475776149bytes. Shape digest attests names/kinds/modes/lengths only, not full content/metadata. Review found symlink times were not copied; metadata reconciliation012 is explicit setup before Init, preserving003.

Runtime build005 passed but selected13 newer transitive registry versions and is unused. Attempt006 showed cargo generate-lockfile regenerates latest compatible even when seeded; lead's first remedy was wrong. Seeding core lock then ordinary offline metadata resolution007 preserves86registry packages with zero new/changed versions, confirmed separately. Final locked release build008 passed (12364171917ns external wall). No timing sample or product change.

Harness registry009 own tests35 passed. The stale lane-bound tests010 are retained. Registry contains38cases/222prospective arm-class selections. Duplicate untracked r7/cache.py was removed by lead before staging after assignment overlap was discovered; canonical residency observer remains r7-cache/residency.py.

Decisions taken under owner direction: class-C identical warmup conflicts E12/E13/C12 remain explicit NOT_RUN; B is L-only; exact E03 wc-only timed stream oracle remains unavailable. P's required native live ownership maps are harness custody, not kept product state. Stage0 diagnostics plan11 uses additive generic observation with no new retained state. Fresh-context agent spawn failed at thread limit; existing agents cross-review separate ownership, with limitation retained.
