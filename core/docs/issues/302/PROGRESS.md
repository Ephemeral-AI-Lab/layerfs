## 2026-10-03 — Plan committed; step 1 blocked

- Plan commit: `2ecb607bf`. The uncommitted packet and amended core rules were
  read from the primary checkout; neither was changed or copied.
- M0 is **BLOCKED**, not complete. The guard and service tool are NOT_RUN.
  No new dependency, crate or image pin has been selected. The owner's prompt
  explicitly authorizes steps 2, 3, 4a and 4b while these questions remain open.
- Exact questions posted to [#302](https://github.com/Ephemeral-AI-Lab/layerfs/issues/302#issuecomment-5968520720):

3. Approve a 14th crate for Init, named `layerfs-project`?
10. May `cargo test` for the engine crates fail when the containers are absent (recommended), rather than skip?
12. Which PostgreSQL major version and MinIO release are pinned?

- Checks run: source/plan review, branch and base identity checks, exact
  first-parent/staged-tree production LOC comparison, committed-tree identity
  confirmation. Product fmt, clippy, package tests, boundary guard and tools
  tests NOT_RUN for the docs-only plan commit; they are required per subsequent
  implementation step. No milestone is marked complete.
- Diagnostics: no operation counters recorded; no product or timed sample run.
- LOC method: `python3 tools/production_loc.py --json --root <snapshot>` using
  identical root counter, Rust comment/inline-test exclusions and shipped SQL,
  with `git archive` snapshots of the first parent and staged tree. Nonproduction
  files may be omitted when materializing snapshots; all tracked Rust/SQL inputs
  in both source scopes are retained. The resulting commit tree and parent are
  checked against the comparison.
- Reference: 65,417 -> 65,417; core: 70,279 -> 70,279;
  core old-path: 6,141 -> 6,141; new-path: 0 -> 0;
  rest-core: 64,138 -> 64,138. No relocation or retirement yet.
- All 13 plan questions remain open. Step 5 additionally needs Q2 and a pinned
  MinIO environment; step 6 needs Q1 and a pinned PostgreSQL environment;
  step 8 needs Q3; step 10 needs Q5–Q9. Step 12 waits for cluster 2 retirement.

Production LOC: 135696 -> 135696 (delta +0)

## 2026-10-03 — Step 2 read seam

Implementation commit is the commit containing this entry (parent `15155598b`).
Row types and the mutex helper relocate with adaptation; signature SQL relocates
from encoding into `sqlite/source.rs`. Both storage paths coexist; none is retired.
The source correction is recorded in implementation-plan §2 and architecture 05.

Checks run once at the implemented tree:

- `cargo +1.85.1 fmt --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml --all -- --check` — PASS.
- `cargo +1.85.1 clippy --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings` — PASS; the server and SDK build.
- `cargo +1.85.1 test --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml --locked -p layerfs-storage -p layerfs-server -p layerfs-sdk` — command PASS: 295 tests passed, 0 failed, 1 existing ignored test.
- `python3 core/tools/check_product_boundary.py` — PASS, 360 Rust/SQL files.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s core/tools -p 'test_*.py'` — PASS, 10 tests.
- `git diff --check` — PASS.

Gap: `layerfs-server/tests/direct.rs::authenticated_generic_save_accepts_4097_separated_final_runs`
remains ignored by the existing owner instruction, "already passed once; owner
directed no further 4097 runs". It was not re-enabled or run. No milestone is
claimed complete, and this omission is retained for M1 review. No red result,
repair or rerun. No timed sample or new operation counter recorded in this slice.

Counter method is the same first-parent/final-staged-tree root counter as above;
reference 65,417 -> 65,417; core 70,279 -> 70,375;
old-path 6,141 -> 6,184; new-path 0 -> 53; rest-core 64,138 -> 64,138.
The increase reflects the coexistence seam and adapted relocation, not a saving.
All owner questions remain open; M0 is still blocked.

Production LOC: 135696 -> 135792 (delta +96)
